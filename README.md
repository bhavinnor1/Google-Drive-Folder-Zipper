Zip Google Drive Folders without using your internet and save the zip file in your Google Drive (Shared Drive Support, and File Exclusion Support too ❤️)

You can also exclude files in a folder while making zip files

If your folder has 100 files

1> Kimi no na wa.mp4

2> Hyouka.mp4

3> Silent Voice.mp4

4> Oregairu.mp4

..

...

.....

100> I want to eat your pancreas.mp4

[Note:- Put an "e" after the entering path with a space in between to access file exclusion if you don't put "e" then program will make a zip file of the whole selected folder.]

You can put

5-100

(This will make a zip file containing only the first four files)

Or

You can put

1,5,15-100

This will make a zip file containing:-
2,3,4 , 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14
